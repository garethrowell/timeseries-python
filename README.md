# spike-farm

To use numpy and pandas to process large climate datasets to identify when high temperature spikes have occurred across NPS park unit landscapes. Temperature spikes would be identified by determining WHEN the top decile of tmaxs occur. Develop massive sequential SORTs across chunks of data. The visualization involves showing the distribution of spikes through time by park unit. Visualization tools to include mathplotlib and Seaborn.
