# temperature-spikes
Build a data visualization using Python data science tools

Preliminary idea is to use Pandas to process tmax climate data using sorts to identify when temperature spikes have occurred across NPS park unit landscapes. Temperature spikes would be identified by determining WHEN the top decile of tmaxs occur. The visualiation involves showing the distribution of spikes through time by park unit.
