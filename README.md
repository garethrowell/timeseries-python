# timeseries-python

This project explores the application of supervised ML in Python to create forecast models from complex real-world time series data. The sample data used throughout this project is a .csv download of climate data from the Alaska Climate Research Center Station at Glacier Bay, AK. 

What would a numpy array look like for managing climate data? An empty container (structured array) might look something like

glba_tmax = np.zeros(





# To do

1. Acquire metadata for Glacier Bay ACIS data. 

2. Write some scripts to clean up the data and create a Julian data starting at 1/01/1990 and running through 12/31/2019.

3. Design structured numpy array for "typical" climate data.
