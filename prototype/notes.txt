Here's an agricultural take on sort algorithms. You have a big field with say, 1000 pumpkins. 
You are going to harvest all of the pumpkins but you only want to take the biggest 100 pumpkins to the fair.
Simple, sort the pumpkins from smallest to largest and take the biggest pumpkins to the fair.

Now, imagine you have an unknown number of pumpkins in farm that has 9 separate fields all planted to pumpkins. 
You want to harvest all of the pumpkins but you will only sell the top 10% for Halloween pumpkins.
