Here's an agricultural take on sort algorithms. You have a field with say, 200 pumpkins. 
You are going to harvest all of the pumpkins but you only want to take the biggest 20 pumpkins to the fair.
Simple, sort the pumpkins from smallest to largest and take the biggest pumpkins to the fair.

Now, imagine you have an unknown number of pumpkins on farm that has 9 separate fields all planted to pumpkins. 
You want to harvest all of the pumpkins but you will only sell the biggest 10% as Halloween pumpkins.
You have a wagon that can haul about a 200 pumpkins which is about the amount from one field. So you are going 
to fill the wagon about 9 times, each time with about 200 pumpkins. How do you identify the top 10%?

You would need the total number to know how many would make the top 10%. But you have to sort each field as you go.
