# Pumkin Problem 

Here's an agricultural take on sort algorithms. You have a field with say, 200 pumpkins. 
You are going to harvest all of the pumpkins but you only want to take the biggest 20 pumpkins to the fair.
Simple, sort the pumpkins from smallest to largest and take the biggest pumpkins to the fair.

Now, imagine you have an unknown number of pumpkins on farm that has 9 separate fields all planted to pumpkins. 
You want to harvest all of the pumpkins but you will only sell the biggest 10% as Halloween pumpkins.
You have a wagon that can haul about a 200 pumpkins which is about the amount from one field. So you are going 
to fill the wagon about 9 times, each time with about 200 pumpkins. How do you identify the top 10%?

This is the problem. The pumpkins from the different fields aren't from the same population, some fields produce bigger
pumpkins than others. So if you just took the top 10% from each field, you would not have the top 10% of all fields combined. 
Ideally, you would harvest all of the pumpkins then sort them from smallest to largest, then separate off the 
top 10%. But you don't have enough room in your farm yard to do that. 

Something you could do with a computer but not by hand, repeated random sample and rank to learn the range
of weights in the top ten percent. Then apply that range on the entire population. This approximation method
can be tested against an actual known population to get an unbiased estimator.
