Here's an agricultural take on sort algorithms. You have a field with say, 200 pumpkins. 
You are going to harvest all of the pumpkins but you only want to take the biggest 20 pumpkins to the fair.
Simple, sort the pumpkins from smallest to largest and take the biggest pumpkins to the fair.

Now, imagine you have an unknown number of pumpkins on farm that has 9 separate fields all planted to pumpkins. 
You want to harvest all of the pumpkins but you will only sell the biggest 10% as Halloween pumpkins.
You have a wagon that can haul about a 200 pumpkins which is about the amount from one field. So you are going 
to fill the wagon about 9 times, each time with about 200 pumpkins. How do you identify the top 10%?

This is the problem. The pumpkins from the different fields aren't from the same population, some fields produce bigger
pumpkins than others. So if you just took the top 10% from each field, you would not have the top 10% of all fields combined. 
Ideally, you would harvest all of the pumpkins then sort them from smallest to largest, then separate off the 
top 10%. But you don't have enough room in your farm yard to do that. You are required to sort them in batches of 200.

You could create a hash with a unique id for each pumpkin and its weight, then sort the weights and 
flag to top 10 percentile. So now, instead of pumpkins, you are just using a hash. You still can't identify
the top 10 percentile until you have weighed every pumpkin. But you don't have to weigh all of the pumpkins at once. 
You can do that one wagon at a time. 

Combining separate hashes. You still need to combine all of your weights then sort the weights to get the 
top 10%. But now, you only need the keys to select the actual pumpkins. 

Nine wagons
Wagon no. 1          2          3           4           5          6           7           8          9
Median    6          8         14           3           5          27          32         14          6
Min       2          3         11           1           1          5           6          5           7
Max       10        14         15           7           9          38          42         23          12

Because of the min/max values, we know most of the wagons overlap in weight distribution. So within wagon ranking 
hasn't helped at all. How can we rank all of them without looking at them all at once?

We could rank all of the pumpkins in wagon 1. Then take one pumpkin out of a wagon 2 and find out where it would fit
in among the ranks of wagon 1. Do that with each pumpkin in wagon 2. Now you only have to have a key for each pumpkin, and 
hold 200 pumpkins + 1 at any given time. Once you have assigned every pumpkin a rank size relative to all of the pumpkins
in wagon 1, you keep all of the pumpkins that are ranked in among the top 10 percent of wagon 1 and discard the rest. 
Now you have kept a bunch of pumpkins that you know are at least in the top 10 percentile of wagon 1 and have eliminated a bunch
of pumpkins that you know are definitely are not. You still have a bunch of pumpkins that are not in the top overall 10 percentile but you have eliminated a bunch of pumpkins that are definitely not in the top 10 percentile while only looking at 201 pumpkins at any given moment.
